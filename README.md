Come talk on [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/n3JFkVk "Automotons Discord")!

### Automotons
Small robots that run instructions (in the form of items called modules), and carry heads that provide functionality.

Currently, six heads (diamond drill, sticky head, iron blade, redstone panel, dispenser on a stick, note block on a stick) and fourteen modules (move, rotate, engage, handle errors, repetition) exist.
More are planned.

Automotons is still in a buggy state. Testing (and PRs!) are appreciated. Expect to encounter issues. All items are craftable.

The mod depends on Patchouli, but doesn't yet contain documentation. Documentation is planned for 1.0.
