Come talk on [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/n3JFkVk "Automotons Discord")!

### Automotons
Small robots that run instructions (in the form of items called modules), and carry heads that provide functionality.

Currently, seven heads (diamond drill, sticky head, iron blade, redstone panel, dispenser on a stick, note block on a stick, electromagnet head) and fourteen modules (move, rotate, engage, handle errors, repetition) exist.
More are planned.

Automotons is still in a buggy state. Testing (and PRs!) are appreciated. Expect to encounter issues.

This mod depends on Patchouli for the documentation. All items have documentation.
