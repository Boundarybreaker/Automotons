When an engaged automoton holding a Steel Hammer rotates into a space with exactly two items, it will attempt to combine them - first checking smithing recipes, then trying to combine them as an anvil would."

If the held item's name begins with '++', it will append the rest of the name. If the name begins with '~~' followed by a positive integer, it will remove that number of letters from the end of the name. Otherwise, it will set the dropped items' names to the name of the held item. Items named this way have a minimum length of one character, and a maximum length of 40."
